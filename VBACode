'This VBA macro is designed to be executed within an Excel workbook. When assigned to a button on an Excel worksheet, it prompts the user to enter their grade. Based on the input, it then determines and displays whether the user has passed or not.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. **Open a New Input Box**: When the button associated with this macro is clicked, an input box is displayed, prompting the user to enter their grade.
2. **Capture User Input**: The grade entered by the user is captured and stored in a variable.
3. **Evaluate the Grade**: The macro evaluates the entered grade to determine if it meets the passing criteria.
4. **Display the Result**: A message box is then displayed, informing the user whether they have passed or not based on the entered grade.

To use this macro, follow these steps:

1. Open your Excel workbook.
2. Insert a button (Form Control) onto your worksheet.
3. Assign this macro to the button.
4. Click the button to run the macro and interact with the input and message boxes.

This macro enhances the interactivity of your Excel workbook by providing immediate feedback on grade evaluations.'

        If CInt(grade) >= passingGrade Then
            MsgBox "Congratulations, you passed!"
        Else
            MsgBox "Sorry, you did not pass."
        End If
